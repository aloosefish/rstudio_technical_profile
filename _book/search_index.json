Journalists sift through terabytes of leaked documents to find and investigate stories (WikiLeaks, Panama Papers). Marketers and designers use data on web traffic, site visitor behavior, even which areas of a page visitors focus cursors on to evalute how well a new campaign is working (Google Analytics).

RStudio has been on the forefront of this evolution. This report is a profile of RStudio. It focuses on how they have affected the evolution of data analytics by its creation of tools to advance the R programming language and statistical computing environment. They also produce materials that teach these tools, including blogs, interactive tutorials, and books. 4.1 Evolution of R https://doi-org.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2018.01169. 4.1.0.1 Beginnings R began as a pet project of two statistics professors at the University of Auckland, New Zealand in 1993.
